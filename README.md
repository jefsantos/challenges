Hello Team.

This version is with the ManytoMany mapping rule.

In my view, an invoice can have more than 1 client, and 1 client can have 1 invoice or more.

in this case, there are Store Client table, invoice and table linking the two tables (foreign key).

I tested the application via PostMan, and the return is Json.


I used the following tech in this application:
Java 11
springboot
JPA
hibernate
Mservices
MySql
Eclipse IDE

Best Regards
